# Design Goal
A small hand-held battery operated BBQ/Smoker temperature controller that can run stand alone with minimal needed configuration to allow for oscillation free temperature control. 

... and it is also be possible to control and monitor over wifi, but that is optional.

For other compiler options check config.h for other options. When time permits I can make them into more options that can be set of MQTT.

# Configuration

The device will use the know wifi network or it wil present itself as a WIFI accesspoint using
the wifimanager.
Just connect to that accesspoint and open a browser to configure WIFI andf MQTT.

# Run unit tests

* requires cmake to be installed, also assumes you ran ```pio run``` before

``` bash
cd libtest
mkdir build

# MQTT Messages

MQTT is used to change it´s configuration and monitor your BBQ (along side the OLED display if used).

I use [MQTT Spy](https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt-spy/releases)  to spy for messages and use OpenHAB to push the status messages into influxdb. Since the controller only talks to a MQTT message broker, you are free to use any other tools for that, I hear that [Node-RED](https://nodered.org) is pretty cool. Messages are send as key/value pairs to keep things simple.

## Status messages

Topic: ```BBQ/<your device>/status```

Status messages are send to an MQTT broker each time any of the following variables changed. Status messages are great to monitor the progress during cooking.

| name | type  |  Meaning | value  | Unit  | Note |
|---   |---    |---       |---     |---    |---   |
| to   | float | Temperature sensor 1, usually pit temp  | 0..250 | celsius | |
| t2   | float | Temperature sensor 2, usually meat temp  | 0..250 | celsius | |
| sp   | float | Setpoint temperature  | 90..240  | celsius  | |
| f1   | float | Ventilator 1 speed  | 0..100  | % | |
| f1o  | float | Ventilator 1 speed override  | -1..100  | %  | When set > -1 it´s in override mode |
| lo   | bool | Lid Open detection  | 0 or 1  | 1 When lid open is detected  |
| lc   | bool | Low Charcoal detection  | 0 or 1  | 1 When low charcoal is detected |
| ft   | long | Type of fan PWM or OnOff  | 0 or 1  | 0 for PWM 1 for OnOff |

Example message:
```to=130.5 t2=60.2 sp=130.0 f1=25 lo=0 lc=0 f1o=-1 ft=1```

__Note: To switch to JSON outout issue the following MQTT command__

topic: ```BBQ/<your device>/controllerConfig```

value: ```statusJson=B1```


### Config messages

Topic: ```BBQ/<your device>/config```
Topic: ```BBQ/<your device>/config/state``` each time any of the variables are changed the configuration is published to this topic

The controller uses a single topic to configure the behavior.

| name | type  |  Meaning | value  | Default | Unit  | Note |
|---   |---    |---       |---     |---      |---    |---   |
| sp   | float | Set the desired temperature | 90..240 | 30.0 | Celsius |
| lof  | int   | Set a fanspeed when the lid is detected as open | -1..100 | 0 | - | -1 keeps the fan running by control of the controller using it´s current speed |
| ood  | long | On Off fan control duty cycle | 2000..120000 | 30000 | ms | If PWM fan control does not work you can try ON/OFF fan control. See compiler option |
| f1o  | float | Override fan 1 | -1..100 | -1 | % | -1 will set it to auto mode, eg let the controller handle the speed. Any value > -0.5 will be in override |
| fl1  | float,float, float,float | Fuzzy set for Low Fan |  0..100 | 0.0,0.0,0.0,50.0 | % | |
| fm1  | float,float, float,float | Fuzzy set for Medium Fan |  0..100 | 25.0,50.0, 50.0,75.0 | % | |
| fh1  | float,float, float,float | Fuzzy set for High Fan |  0..100 | 50.0,100.0, 100.0,100.0 | % | |
| tel  | float,float, float,float | Fuzzy set for low temperature error |  0-XX | 0.0,10.0 | Celsius | |
| tem  | float,float, float,float | Fuzzy set for medium temperature error |  0-XX | 0.0,15.0, 15.0,30.0 | Celsius | |
| teh  | float,float, float,float | Fuzzy set for high temperature error |  0-XX | 15.0,200.0, 200.0,200.0 | Celsius | |
| tcf  | float,float, float,float | Fuzzy set for temperature drop detection |  0-XX | 10.0,20.0, 20.0,30.0 | Celsius | |
| ft | long | 0 for PWM, 1 for OnOff ventilator type | 0,1 | | |

Example messages to ```BBQ/config```:

* ```sp=130.0``` Set the desired pit temp to 130 degree Celsius
* ```f1o=55``` Override fan speed to 55%
* ```f1o=-1 sp=180.0``` Enable auto mode and set desired temp to 180Celsius in one configuration line

### Setup type of Ventilator

Not all ventilator can be controller well with PWM, this is why we can also use
a On/Off type fan. Default duty cycle is 30 seconds but can be changed with ood command.

topic: ```BBQ/<your device>/controllerConfig```

value: ```fan1Type=L1``` Set type of fan to On/Off

value: ```fan1Type=L0``` Set type of fan to PWM (19Khz for ESP32)

### OnOff type duty cycle

Set´s the duty cycle in ms of the OnOff fan type 15.000 to 30.000 seems to be a good time

topic: ```BBQ/<your device>/controllerConfig```

value: ```fan1DutyCycle=L25000``` (no range checking done, ensure it´s >0 )

### PWM minimal speed

Ventilators controlled by PWM do have an issue that they don´t run very well on lower ranges, or they won´t start up well.
To change the start % issue the following command:

topic: ```BBQ/<your device>/controllerConfig```

value: ```fan1Start=L50``` (no range checking done, ensure it´s >0 and <100)

This means that if the controller range is mapped from 0..100% to PWM range 50%..100%,
thus 1% required results in 50.5% duty cycke to the fan. 
How to test what value work for you. In the menu turn the fan off and wait untill the fan stops.
Then in the menu set it to 1%. The fan should startup and slow down again. If it keeps running,
you found the correct value.

Note: The fan get's 'kicked' for 500ms at 75% duty cycle to get it into motion.

## Setting up temperature sensors

Temperature sensor 1 is always connected to the BBQ Controller but you can select the type of sensor.
Temparature sensor 2 is the sensor to be used as your free probe.

Example: First sensor set as MAX31856 while the other is used for NTC

topic: ```BBQ/<your device>/controllerConfig```

value: ```sensor1Type=L0``` // 0 == MAX31856 1 == MAX31855 2 = NTC

value: ```sensor2Type=L2``` // 0 == MAX31856 1 == MAX31855 2 = NTC

### Setting up NTC sensor

For both sensors we use the steinhart calculations to correct for non-linearity of the NTC sensor.
You can setup R, c1, c2, c3 and the potential offset.

[Temperature-Probe-Cooking](https://www.instructables.com/id/ESP32-NTP-Temperature-Probe-Cooking-Thermometer-Wi/)

topic: ```BBQ/<your device>/controllerConfig```

value: ```NTC1Stein=Sr=10000 c1=-.0050990868 c2=0.0011737742 c3=-0.0000031896162 c=0 o=0```

value: ```NTC1Pin=L36``` // Use pin 36 of the esp32 as analog 1 for NTC sensor 1

Note: For correct ADC conversion use pin number above 32, this is because the ESP32 shares ADC2 with WIFI functions, therefor we can use ADC1 which si connected to pin 32..39

```r``` is the resistor you use in your serial devider circuit.
```c ``` is the downstream/upstream configuration. When c=0 then it's downstream configuration.
```o``` is a offset that can be applied to offset any linear offset from the AD converter. If the temperature measured shows to high, then this number should be positive.

### Let the controller calculate the steinhart cooeficients

Take 3 temperatures and with a multimeter check the resistor. Then send this
to the topic.

topic: ```BBQ/<your device>/steinhart```

value: ```ntc=1 r=4700 r1=2000 r2=8900 r3=35500 t1=88 t2=47 t3=16 c=0 o=0```

```r``` is the resistor you use in your serial devider circuit.
```c ``` is the downstream/upstream configuration. When c=0 then it's downstream configuration.
```o``` is a offset that can be applied to offset any linear offset from the AD converter. If the temperature measured shows to high, then this number should be positive.

The controller will now calculate the steinhart cooeficients and stores them.

* Connect MAX31865 and MAX31855 to V3.3 Some MAX31855 shields only have 3.3V  and *WILL* break when connected to 5V
* Connect the Lin potentiometer between V3.3 and DGND. Middle pint should go to analog in. The wemos device pin A0 has a build in step-down from 3.3V to 1V
* Connect the button with a 10K pul-up to V3.3 
* To use Fan control use a mos-fet or transistor for PWM fan control. Alternative you can use ON/OF fan control of PWM is not working out (see also compile options to select between the methods). 
* If you notice some noise through the Lin-Potentiometer: add a 0.1uF radiaal Elco between the middle pin and DGND.

MAX31855 is a two wire connection to a k-type thermocouple and has a positive and negative side. Make sure you connect them correctly. I don´ think the device will break if incorrectly connected.
MAX31865 is a 3 or 4 wire connection to a PT100 thermocouple. Read this carefully : [Adafruit 4-Wire RTDs](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-max31865-rtd-pt100-amplifier/rtd-wiring-config) The general idea is that if you have a 3 or 4 wire thermocouple you need
to reconfigure the shield accordingly. When incorrectly connected you won´ break the device but you will get incorrect readings.

## Node-Red Blynk Flow

MVP version will use a node-red flow to communicate with a Blynk application to monitor and control 
basic functionality of your smoker/BBQ and to provide notifications on your cellphone when a important
event happened. The Blynk application has been designed such that you can use the free version so the fact
that it doesn´t ook fancy is just the limitation of the free version. Feel free to expand. The node-red
flow does put out the values to the virtual points
To use Blynk you need to get a free account and get a auth-token you need to fill in to your node-red flow.

### What you need

* Free blynk account [Blynk](https://blynk.io)
* Access to Mosquitto MQTT broker, you could use an free online version MQTT broker or a local version on your rpi 
* Access to nodered. I think there are some onlineversions but you need a few modules installed, not sure if that is possible. I have tested this on my local rpi
* node-red-contrib-string
* node-red-contrib-blynk-ws 
* node-red-dashboard

### Blynk Application you can import
![Blynk Share](images/blynk.png "Blynk Application you can import")
![Blynk Application](images/blynkapp.png "BBQ Blynk Application")

### Node Red Flow
Import the file ```support/nodered-blynk.json``` into a seperate tab then configure your mosquitto node and
your blynk node. It includes a very small dashboard toview values to verify connectiviy. Feel free to make
this a fully working dashboard!
The dashboard can be accesses at : (http://<your IP of node red>:1880/ui/)[http://localhost:1880/ui/]
